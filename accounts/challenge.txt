Create templates for

password_reset_email.html *
password_reset_done.html *
password_reset_complete.html *
and
password_reset_confirm.html

The password_reset_confirm.html template will require a form
that the user will input their new password into.

This form can be accessed using {{ form }} and contains password1 and password2 fields.


These files will need to be added to the templates/registration directory
